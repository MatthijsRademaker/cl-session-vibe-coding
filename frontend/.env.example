# API URL - must be accessible from the browser (not from within Docker)
# For local dev and Docker: use localhost
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# NOTE: Do NOT use http://chatbot-backend:5000
# That hostname only works for container-to-container communication,
# but the browser (client) runs on your host machine and needs localhost
